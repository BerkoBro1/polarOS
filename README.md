# This is a passion project, where I am trying to create a working OS in Java, by creating a window that opens and closes with the base OS' boot and shut down.
# To develop an app, import the polarOS Dev Package, or pDP into your java project. The init function should be:

#  public void start(JDesktopPane pane) {
#    JInternalFrame frame = CreateFrame.create(//params go here);
#  }

# The start function is called by the app launcher to create the frame. Also, take note that this project uses Java swing, not FX. It doesn't matter what you put in the frame,
# as long as it can go in the frame. Once you have the frame, do whatever you want with it!

# This is a passion project, and i hope you enjoy.
